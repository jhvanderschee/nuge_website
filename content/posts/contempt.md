## Reminder
This post has got something to do with the previous post, [see](/posts/kominfo). That shit hurt, and I'm not done rambling, but this time I'm fully clear out of the fog.

## What I Mean by Digitally Contemplating?
One might say that what I meant by "***contemplating digitally***" is equal to commenting or creating a blog post about a concern, but I decided to took it to another direction that fit the *status quo*.

For me, when you contemplate digitally is when your concern takes you hostage and took control of your habit on the internet (*e.g. downloading software to unblock website, reading article about technology*). Maybe this is some kind of a coping mechanism, like drugs and what not, maybe, just maybe...

Human's will to live is greater than you think, but when you take that away from them, physically or not, because humans are capable of doing so, they bound to do something immediate, or with the presence of authority, they will suffer and have to deal with the thought-provoking idea. That's why through out the history, especially in politic and state's life, the will is the driving force of human evolution and downfall. The will of many, or collective will is always been a major force from the country, the collective will of the class, the conflict of the class which is the conflict of the will.

I've contemplate digitally, downloading software and many things that would prevent my digital freedom to be stolen from the government. Once the effect has settle in, that's when you really, **really** look at how fucked up your country is, and it becomes a concern on both life
- Real World
- Digital World

## The Problem with Indonesia & Digital Narcissism
Whether you're outside of the country from which I'm from (*Indonesia*), you might heard about Indonesia, at least a part of them or a region (*e.g. Bali, Jakarta*). They always talk about how beautiful the country is, and it is, at least when we talk about scenery and nature, when it comes to living condition, it's not even close to the painting.

Indonesia label themselves as a **growing** country, their technology and economic strives, they boast about ***Society 5.0***, an idea or a concept in which human and technology **coexist**, this is sooo great, why? Because it could expose, and visualize the corruption in Indonesia, but in terms of effeciency for the people, and its impact on economy and technological advances? It's a far cry. I will talk more about the corruption and all of that later, but now let's focus more on Indonesia and its agenda.

Let's talk about Indonesia's  **G20 Presidency**. The point of it is to
> *Build a strategic multilateral platform to connect to other country with huge economy in the world.*

It's basically a platform in which 20 countries sat down and aggre-disagree or what not, for it could be seen as the act of growing the global economy. And Indonesia happens to be their next place this year.

Now let's talk about why Indonesia has painted the big painting with turd. This is the section where I'll get **kidnapped** by the government ðŸ˜±
