# The Importance of Tools
The difference between the **nowadays** vs **past** academic era is that we have more tools to make our day to day college life easier, everything is now digital, and many tools you can acquire and use for the low-low price of **FREE**.

As of writing, I am now going to be attending the third semester this year. Oh how I wish I'd known these tools sooner, because the first two semester was a big **MESS**. For me it was management, sure I did some cleaning and organizing on folder to folder based on the class I take, so I could find the expected files easily.

I need something more than just organizing set files, so I found these ***softwares*** that'll guide me, and possibly you too!

# Softwares

## Espanso

I found this software because I was having problem with my other software by mistake. ***Espanso*** is the kind of software they called "*text expander*", and I think it really does fit the description. 

Remember when you're trying to write paper and you couldn't remember that one lecturer's name and his or her titles, 

### Example
```
  - trigger: ";myname" → Typed text
    replace: "Anugerah" → Replaced by this
```
