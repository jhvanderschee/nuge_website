# Technical Life Update

So what is next right? Well...
Currently I have so many things to do and manage, since I am still studying in college. There are many projects that I've been working on, such as:
1. Graphic Design Zine (***Merchant-Zine***)
2. Managing a division in debating competition
3. Studying... of course
4. Another web project for an organization

As you can see, these are important things that I must be doing, and I don't have any particular order as of the urgency of each tasks.

More importantly, let's discuss about the blog itself, what's new and what's to come!
- ~~RSS function~~
- ~~Print button~~
- Art Gallery (for my arts)
- Digital Zine??!!

I think these are more than enough, the completed task and the ongoing one are equal. Even though they seems to be to little or not much, believe me... **IT'S A LOT!** 

# Personal Life Update
I haven't done anything like this before, since this is my own platform, and I can do everything I want, then I will do just so. To set things up let's start with pop culture!

### Music that I am in Love with!
*The list is not in a particular order!*
+ The Beatles
+ The Who
+ Cream
+ The Rolling Stones

Based taste I know, but they really are a good bunch! Anyway, The Beatles has just released the remixed version of their famous and revolutionary album called, "***Revolver***" it sounds really good!

### Movie that I've watched

## REAL
So I've been down lately or nowadays, because I've gained so much weight, and also I'm not really productive, but I'm catching on to a good habit soon enough!

### What I hope I'll Achieved Some day!
- Lose weight
- Read more books
- Write more stuff!
