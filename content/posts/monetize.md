# The Many Reasons
Just in case there's one of you or maybe many, that wanted to know the many reasons I chose this. It's actually simple, if you're an avid human being, a functional ***Homo Sapiens***, then you already know, I'm just going to list all of them, because people like lists!
1. **Money â‰  Happy**
2. **Freedom**
3. **Website bloat**
4. **Managing**
5. **F*ck the corporate**

*Summaries*:
I'm just a red-pilled leftist, who hates the **industrial society**.
