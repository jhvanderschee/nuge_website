<p class="story">
God uses all the colors he had, and he was left only with green paint, and then he painted something beautiful, but he forgot to wash and clean his brush, making his beautiful green forest – dangerous to other creatures. Five in the morning, god looked upon his canvas. Enraged with what he just saw, he decided to take a break and leave the canvas to paint a new one.

<p class="story">
How is the king? The king stepped into the forest, of course. He was, sucked into a whole new world. A world in which nature is king. The king had long lusted for the presence of water; walking amongst the grass and the trees somehow reminds him of the kingdom he left, the carpet and the pillars, but that doesn’t matter, water is king now. He walked miles for miles until, god’s blue paint was there, a pond. The king is so happy and excited, and then he came running even though he was carrying quite a heavy equipment. With both of his hands shaking, he scoops up a quite bit of water from his palm, he quenches his thirst with the water, looking up at the sky where the light hit his face, in that time, he felt a warm sensation on his face and his body. He left the pond after he’d rested for a while, he looked upon his reflection on the surface of the water, “How could the people have left me? Was there a kingdom far greater than mine? Would they’ve gone there instead?” pondered the king, the thought gave him a drowsy feeling, the king feel into slumbers.
