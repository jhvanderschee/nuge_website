# Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
### by Hunter S. Thompson
★★★★☆

What a nice piece of **raw** and **gritty** social commentary about America and the ***American Dream***.

Hunter S. Thompson, depicted here as **Duke**, goes on a drug-fueled journey to Las Vegas to cover some story for a magazine with his attorney, **Dr.Gonzo**. And what they found there was something different, the first task that the magazine gave never had been realized by Duke. He and his companion fascinatingly found something **filthy** and more interesting than what had been given to them.

Opinions are written as a harsh and **unfiltered** dialogue between man and the people around, essentially keeping the book as a piece of journalism, but in different ways, ***Gonzo Journalism***. This a type of writing that could help the reader to understand fully what the intent and story covered by the journalist. Why? Because it is told in a first-person perspective, in return, putting the journalist as the person who will guide you from the beginning and through the shit-hole. He's your driver, and he'll be there to take you to a spectacle, unaware by the public eyes.

It is a nice taxi ride, you'll see filth everywhere, and you'll argue with the driver,  but you'll remember the ride.

>Buy the ticket, take the ride.
- Hunter S. Thompson
