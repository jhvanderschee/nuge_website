You want to write but don't know where and how? Or do you want to store your writing so you can look them up even though it is not saved directly to your devices? Well, my solution to the problems I had with writing can be solved by just one thing.

## Blog
A **Blog** is where people can write and post their writing about anything, to the ***internet!*** On the early days of the internet, **Blog** was the king, and queen, it was the hot thing all around, a place where you can speak and share your pieces of mind or experiences. Many services were given to people for free, but it had limitation in terms of feature and looks/style.

As you can see from the picture above, it is not different from what I am trying to do right now, the layout might be outdated, but all the features of modern **Blog** is still there! It might be the default template and etc, but it was and still is acceptable and readable, but it was not fully customizable.

## Freedom in Blogging
You like to write on ***Normies*** social media such as:
- **Instagram**,
- **Facebook**,
- and  **Twitter**?

And you feel so free when you share your stuff there? I'm afraid I'm going to give you this ðŸ’Š, strap in for the ride bois.

Either you don't know how internet work, or you're just being **lazy** and **ignorant**, the privacy of your data, and how you want your writing to be, are controlled by the ***Media*** itself, the social space doesn't include and allow people to speak their mind freely, and that's why you need to be independent and create your own **space**/**media** where you can be free and creative without any limitation. You can only use the ***Mainstream*** social media as a way to promote your **BLOG**. If you still using the already mentioned social media, then you're acting accordingly as how they want you to be, you're not taking **control** of the social media, they're the one who are taking **control** of you.

## Start BLOGGING now!
People fear blogging because it has something to do with website, and website has something to do with **programming**, and **coding**. But what people doesn't realize is, you can find **tutorials** and **documentation**, it seems like they just gave up from the start, when the result is much more bigger, and made them much more independent. You could use **Blogger** or **WordPress**, it's an *okay* service if you want to make your own **Blog** real quick and being reliant too much on the service. 

### The problem with WordPress
***WordPress*** is not great! Like any social media, it is limited in feature, some useful feature even **blocked** by an unreasonable paywall that you **can't** even allow yourself to fully **customize** them. You don't even know about your privacy and all of that, because you are too **RELIANT**.

Start becoming **INDEPENDENT**!

### Enter HUGO
Ah, yes... **HUGO**, the tool that I used to build my **Blog**, well... It's technically a [**Static Website**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), this website doesn't have anything complicated. Hugo is a framework for building websites, and it's really useful for building simple static web page such as this, with the basic of **HTML**, **CSS**, and the readily available **Templates**, you can customize this bad-boy with anything you like, add **modules**, your own **function**, and **MANY MORE!**

I'm not kidding when I said that this framework really makes you **independent**. To have a full control of something for once is really something therapeutic and helpful for ourselves.

Down here I will put some useful resources to learn about [**HUGO**](https://gohugo.io/)
