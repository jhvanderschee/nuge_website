At the gate of the kingdom stood a king, and now, the mud leaves a mark on which our journey begins...
</p>

<p class="story">
It was a wet morning, for it was raining all night, and the king walks along the path, the path was very straight, there were no ups and downs or winding paths either, the path was like the people, built and stepped only for the king's pleasure. He, the king, was walking very grandly, and slowly, as to display an attitude of a king. For what purpose it was, none can imagine the expression of the king once he realized there was no path to be found. Where could it be? The path stopped at the entrance of the forest, it was robust, so robust, and full of vines. He looked to his left, and right, and then stared directly at the forest. He pondered for a little while, and it'd occurred to him that in the forest, in that deep and dark of a forest, there could be savages, tigers, lions, and un-godly creatures that linger about.
</p>

<p class="story">
The king decided to go off the path. At these ungodly hours and upon the barren land, he's about to step into a path 'twas unknown to a class such as himself, the path is roamed by outlaws, heathens, and thieves. He trembles for a while, and then he continued, for he's a king. He struggles and heaves himself through the harsh land, there was nothing that could stop this king, he thought to himself.
</p>

<p class="story">
The king walk very far from where he came from, the only sign that he'd known that it was very distant was that he could only hear none... silence. It was distant enough that he could feel himself aging from the walk, as soon as he felt like aging, he found a sight of relief, it was the remnant of war between kingdoms. Ashes from the burned weaponry, swords left to rot as it sinks inside the earth, he smiles a bit at the attraction, and then it comes to his realization that there is a flag upon him that look familiar, it was the flag of his kingdom. It was the site from which he fought for his kingdom and ended up losing, “If it wasn't for the inexperience army 'twas led by a ridiculous captain, we would've won the battle!” cried the king.

<p class="story">
The view was taking a turn on him, he was now agitated at how people cannot be at his level of intelligence, he then once again stopped and ponders, for that is the only thing that could keep him at ease. He then comes to terms with the fact that people that don't have the same title as him cannot be someone like him, for he needs to find sanctuary in another kingdom to meet someone with a title of a king to fulfill his satisfaction of existing. So it is set, he'll find a kingdom with a king that is just as mighty as he.
</p>

<p class="story">
 “I am a divine being sent by the god to lead my people, so true that my family is bestowed upon with riches and luxury” mutter the king as he held his head high and lifts it upon the skies as blackbirds circles above him. Bestowed with riches he was, but he was starting to feel the human desires upon himself, for he is not as divine as he thought he was, he needed a drink and food to go on with the divine mission. He looked around as the sound of a bell rings in his ears, was it the sound of the forest, or the realization of oneself? Entering the forest means that he needed to face danger to seek fulfillment, for the god created the forest for all the creatures, they are available to be used by any kind of creation, to grow, to raise, and to stay at. Surely a divine being like himself, with a divine mission will be guided by the one who rules the kingdom of life himself.
