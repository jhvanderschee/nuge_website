# The Importance of Tools
The difference between the **nowadays** and **past** academic era is that we have more tools to make our day-to-day college life easier, everything is now digital, and many tools you can acquire and use for the low-low price of **FREE**.

As of writing, I am now going to be attending the third semester this year. Oh how I wish I'd known these tools sooner, because the first two semesters was a big **MESS**. For me it was management, sure I did some cleaning and organizing on folder to folder based from the class I take, so I could find the expected files easily.

I need something more than just organizing set files, so I found this list ***software*** that'll guide me, and possibly you too! By the way, this list is not in a particular order, there's no "the best" software, even though you saw them first or last, each software has its functionality and purpose.

# Software

## 1. Espanso

I found this software because I was having problem with my other software by mistake. ***Espanso*** is the kind of software they called "*text expander*", and I think it really does fit the description.

Remember when you're trying to **write** paper and you couldn't remember that one lecturer's name and his or her titles? That's really annoying right? Instead of **searching** list of names and titles of your lecturer, what if we can just **display** their name by typing their **initial**?

Well my friend, say hello to ***Espanso***! As I was saying, this software helps you to **expand** your **text**, you can create some kind of code or a **trigger** word that could be replaced with any word you like, and you can also create a **trigger** to paste an *image* from your **directory**!

### Example
```
  - trigger: ";myname" → Typed text
    replace: "Anugerah" → Replaced by this
    
    ;myname → Anugerah
```

## 2. Zotero
I know that some of you already know about this piece of software, for ***academia*** students this is a must! Writing papers can be a real hassle if you don't know how to automate some of the basic nuisance, like adding **citations** and **bibliography**.

With **Zotero** you can easily add citations and automatically updated bibliography everytime you add new citations. You can manage/create folder for your article paper, be it **PDF**, **Markdown**, and or **snapshot** of *website*. You could use **Zotero** with the most popular *word processor* such as:
+ **Microsoft Word**
+ **Google Document**
+ **LibreOffice**

With the new version of **Zotero** there's a built-in PDF reader that you could use to annote your **PDF** and export them to **Markdown** file!

## 3. Raindrop.io
Have you ever used the **bookmark** function on your web browser? Do you want to organize each and one of your bookmark like this?

{{< rawhtml >}}

{{< /rawhtml >}}

**Raindrop.io** is an advanced bookmarking service, and it is completely free, the only thing you'll miss is the **sub-folder/category** function, and that's alright. Being able to give the bookmarked website tags and categories is really powerful, not only that, but you can also view the website directly from the software, anddddd you could also open **Raindrop.io** online without any download! With the extension for web browsers such as **Google Chrome**, you could save them (*website*) directly without typing the **URL** manually!

So each time you're thinking of organizing your online article, make sure to check this one out! It'll help you with **research**.

## 4. Obsidian
Last but not least, my favorite piece of software! When it comes to writing down and storing information or as I like to call it **Note-taking!**. Many people prefferd to use paper and their own methods of note-taking, but for me, writing down information with pen & papers takes time, and for a student like me, I need to store pool of information as quickly as possible with little time I have.

**Obsidian** is the answer to that. Obsidian uses the **Markdown** file to store our writing, the link back feature (*referencing notes from one to another*) fully customizable interface, and community plugins is why I use it.

With that much customization and a powerful feature, it’s a no-brainer to pick it up. **Markdown** file as you know it, it’s so lightweight and easily accessible without any decoding or anything complex like that, opened it on notepad and it’s still readable. If you don't know how powerful using link to reference your notes is, then you should consider trying **Obsidian**, look for tutorials ,and thank me later! I've been using Obsidian for a long time, and every time I want to write something like this one, I need some related notes to reference and improve the quality of my writing.
